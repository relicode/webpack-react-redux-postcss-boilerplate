# Webpack react-redux boilerplate

A minimalistic webpack-react-redux boilerplate heavily influenced by Juho Vepsäläinen's excellent [SurviveJS - Webpack](https://survivejs.com/webpack/ "SurviveJS - Webpack") guide.

## Requirements

  * NodeJS 8.9.4 LTS or higher in order to natively support _object rest-spread_ and _async/await_ and make the project more future-proof
  * Developed using yarn 1.2.1, but npm should work just as well

## Installation

Run `yarn`.

## Building

To start the development server, run `yarn start`. To build a production release website, run `build:prod`.
